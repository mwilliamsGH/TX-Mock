The renovation brings warm wood tones, additional seating areas, and a stunning new art wall featuring local artists. We've also added more greenery throughout the lobby to create a more welcoming environment. 

The new seating areas provide comfortable spaces for informal meetings or just relaxing. Thank you for your patience during the renovation process. We hope you enjoy the refreshed space.

The lobby is now fully open and accessible during regular building hours. Please feel free to make use of the new seating areas and take time to appreciate the beautiful artwork from local Maple Grove artists.
